# Grocery List

The client app was bootstrapped using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), while the server is based on Apollo GraphQL server.

## Tech Stack Choices

The following technologies were used in building this project:

* React
* TypeScript
* Apollo GraphQL server and client
* TailWindCSS
* Yarn as the package manager
* Jest, JestDom, and React Testing Library as the testing libraries


## Running the Project Locally

To run the project locally, you need to install dependencies in both the client and server directories.
Follow these steps:


```bash
cd Server/
yarn
yarn start
```

The above command should start the GraphQL server and output the following:

```bash
tsc
ðŸš€ Server ready at http://localhost:4000/
```


```bash
cd Client/
yarn
yarn start
```
Executing the above command in the client directory should open a browser window or tab with the URL http://localhost:3000.

```bash
You can now view client in the browser.

  Local:            http://localhost:3000
```

## Running All Tests

To run all tests, execute the following command in the client directory:

```bash
yarn test
```
